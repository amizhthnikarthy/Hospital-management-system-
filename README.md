# Hospital-management-system-
Every hospital entails a large amount of data pertaining to its patients, doctors, pharmacy, blood bank, etc. This necessitates a structured, conducive, and user-friendly interface for managing this data and manipulating it in various ways to attain useful outputs. Especially in the time of a pandemic, it is instrumental that cases, deaths, and recoveries are monitored and duly analyzed to predict the far-reaching implications.
With this in mind, we started working on our project, which includes THREE main modules:

1. ADMIN MODULE
2. DOCTOR MODULE
3. COVID MODULE

Functionality of the modules:
1. The admin presides over the pharmacy, blood bank, appointments of doctors, patient data, and, regular updating. The admin is, also, in charge of maintaining wards and the software generates the bill for the patient at the time of discharge in no time.
2. The doctor views appointments, modifies them, and, deletes them at ease. They can also mail the voice-generated prescription to their patients.
3. The covid module gives the user with data of covid patients, their assigned doctors, personal information, health status, etc. It also gives the user numerous statistical data for interpretation.

Skills: 
1. pyplot module from matplotlib library
2. turtle module
3. mysql.connector module 
4. speech recognition module 
5. numpy library-array module
6. MySQL overall understanding(MySQL workbench)
